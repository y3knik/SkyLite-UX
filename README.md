# About The Project

Skylite UX was conceived as an open source, self-hosted alternative to commercial family managers. Most commercial offerings require expensive hardware and include subscriptions. Our goal was to create an offering that allows you to bring your own hardware, avoid subscriptions, and subscription-associated feature creep while playing nicely with other self-hosted offerings.

## Features

### Home Screen (Screensaver)

Beautiful ambient display perfect for a family command center:

- **Today's Menu** - Shows all meals planned for today with meal type icons (🍳🥗🍽️)
- **7-Day Weather Forecast** - Current conditions plus daily forecasts
- **Upcoming Events** - Next 5 events from Google Calendar with smart date formatting
- **Today's Tasks** - Tasks due today or without due dates
- **Adaptive Backgrounds** - Semi-transparent backgrounds ensure text readability on all photos
